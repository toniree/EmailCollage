# EmailCollage
Ruby on Rails Decal Final Group Project
Group Members: Toni Lee, Chris Hinrichs, Vincent Bartle

Idea
Group users together by email server name (Berkeley.edu, amazon.com, etc.) and take them to a blog of posts from users in the same group. Have the group's blog by default show news articles relevant to the respective group, as well as popular user posts. Maybe support posting media as well.
